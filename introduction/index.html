        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Computer Science (CS) is a broad field and can be confusing to navigate for the aspiring college student. Even if you have chosen a job as a Software Developer, the steps to achieve that career may not be fully understood.</p>
        <p>When I started college all I knew was that I wanted to do something in computer science. When asked to choose one career to explore for this report, I decided to look into the one that was the closest match to what I do in my own time. This led me to software development. Through the course of my research on how to achieve this career I found out more about the differences between software development and software engineering. As I got a better understanding of which focuses on what I am now more interested in how to become a software engineer. Even so I hope that this website on how to become a software developer will help those of you that want to take that path. And maybe for some of you, like me, when you better understand the difference between the two, will discover that software engineering is the path you would rather take instead.</p>
        <p>Now you may be asking yourself the questions: How does software development differ from programing and software engineering? What things do I need to understand before deciding on this career path? How much does software development pay? What is the job security in this field? What are the education requirements? What are the steps required to achieve this career?</p>
        <p>The first few of the following pages will cover in the following order: the methodology in my research, the results of my research, and what conclusions I have drawn. After that there is a page with recommendations based on this research, with a subpage with instructions to help you build an effective resume. There are also two resume examples. There is also a reference page if you would like to read more. I hope you find this information useful in your pursuit of a career in Software Development.</p>
