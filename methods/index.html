    <h1>Methods</h1>
    <h2>Pre Research</h2>
    <p>The first thing I did was identify what questions I had about the topic. Some of these questions were raised
        while performing topic selection. This was because I did some initial research during that process.</p>
    <h2>Questions Asked</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>What is software development?
        <li>What is the difference between a software developer and a software engineer?
        <li>How to write a resume for a software developer job?
        <li>What is a resume summary vs resume objective?
        <li>How should work history be formatted on a resume?
    </ul>
    <h2>Search Engine Selection</h2>
    <p>I initially tried to use Google Scholar to do research but kept either getting quite old sources or ended up
        hitting paywalls. For an explanation on why old sources are bad <a             href="methods/#why-old-bad">click here to goto that part in full process</a></p>
    <h2>Search Result Filtering</h2>
    <p>While searching I filtered out any site that looked like a blog, or where I did not recognize the site domain. I
        also filter out sites that where very generically titled and/or where their about page did not give confidence
        in their authority. Even if I found a blog from a .edu domain, if I did not recognize the institution, I kept
        looking.</p>
    <h2>Cross referencing</h2>
    <p>Whenever possible I would try to find another site to answer the same question. Even if I could be sure of the
        authority of the site I found first, it is always possible that a mistake was made, or bias came through.
        Therefore, it is always a good idea to find more than one source for each query.</p>
    <h2>Full Process</h2>
    <p>One of the first questions that came about was “what is the difference between software developer and software
        engineer?”. This question is important as there is a difference that even I did not know the details of. I had
        already found an article by Indeed that explained it during my topic selection research. Indeed, has a whole
        host of article on all parts of the job-hunting process, from definitions of jobs to differences between them,
        to how to get one, and more. Their whole business is about connecting employers to employees which makes them a
        good source of information about the job hunting process from both sides.</p>
    <p>That first question lead into another “what is the definition of software development?” To answer this question,
        I did a general internet search. During this search I filtered out any site that looked like a blog, or where I
        did not recognize the site domain. I also filter out sites that where very generically titled where there about
        page did not give confidence in their authority. I found a few blogs from .edu domains but I did not recognize
        the institution, so I kept looking. Eventually I found a page on IBM’s website and that had a very thorough
        explanation. IBM has authority to answer this question as they are one of the companies that have been in the CS
        sector for a long time.</p>
    <p>After this I found another site to cross reference from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ “Occupational
        outlook handbook” It also explained the definition as well as giving some numerical statistics about the job and
        more.</p>
    <p>The next question I researched was “How to write a resume for a software developer job?” While researching this
        question I tried to find an article using Google Scholar, but the best I could find was from 2005. <span
            id="why-old-bad">In a field like computer science (CS), almost 20 years is a lot of time, therefore the
            information could not be relied upon.</span> So I kept looking, eventually I ended up back at Indeed. And
        the links in that article lead to answers for other questions such as “What is a resume summary vs resume
        objective?” and “How should work history be formatted on a resume?”</p>
