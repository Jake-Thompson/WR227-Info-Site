        <li>Define your Sections</li>
            <p>There are different ways to Layout a resume, and different ways to name each section header. For these
                Instructions I will be using the sections in figure 1.</p>

        <li>Fill in the Name / Contact Section</li>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Your name should be at the top with a font size bigger (within reason) than the section headers.</li>

                    <li>Do not give all your social media accounts, they do not want to see your twitter, but a more
                        professional one, such as LinkedIn, would be fine.</li>
                    <li>If you want you can include your full address, but there are many reasons you may not want to do
                        this. If so, you can use a more general address such as city and state.</li>

            <p>Use one of the following‚Ä¶</p>
            <ol type="a">
            <li>Resume Objective
                <p>If you are new to the workforce, or are changing careers, or need to communicate that you will/can move for the
            job. Then a resume objective is what you should use.
            <ol type="i">
                <li>In a few sentences communicate what your career goal is, and how the job you are applying for relates.
                <li>For an example see <a href="recommendations/resume-instructions/example-2">Example #2</a>
            </ol>
            <li>Resume Summary
                <p>A resume summary is good for when you have a work history, which you can use to communicate your experience and
            qualifications. For an example see <a href="recommendations/resume-instructions/example-1">Example #1</a>
            </ol>
        <li>Fill in Work Experience if Applicable else goto 5.</li>
            <p>If you have relevant previous work experience then you should list it here.

                <li>Start from the most recent and work backwards.
                <li>First put the company name and location.
                <li>Then put the dates of employment.
                <li>After that, put your job title.

                        <li>this does not have to be in chronological order, I recommend putting them in the order of most important first.
                    </ul>
                <li>Different position in same company?
                    <p>If you had a different position at the same company (promotion / transfer) then add that title followed by the dates in that position, (also add the dates in that position to the first title).
                        <ul class="note">
                            <li>Remember these positions should still be in reverse chronological order.

                    <br>Then you should list it to show you were employed during that time.
                    <ul class="note">
                        <li>But don‚Äôt add the description of responsibilities and accomplishments or change in positions.

        <li>Fill in Education.</li>

            most important relevant ones.

        <li>Fill in any Certifications if exist else goto 7.</li>
            <p>If you have any relevant certifications, you should list them here.

                        <li>If you have a lot, try to tailor the list to be relevant to the job.
                        <li>Try to avoid obscure, not commonly used ones unless you think they might be relevant to the job.
                    </ul>
                <li>Other relevant skills?
                    <p>If you have any other skills that would be relevant to the job, then make a subsection of Code Languages, before adding other skills.
                    <ul class="note">
                        <li>Do not include ambiguous skills that are overused such as ‚ÄúHard Worker‚Äù, ‚ÄúTeam Player‚Äù etc.

                                <li>By relevant I mean, what does the company your applying for do.
                                <li>For example, if they make software for cash registers, do you have any projects that are similar, if so put them first.

                        <li>Do not list too many as that adds clutter.
