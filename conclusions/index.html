        <h1>Conclusions</h1>
        <h2>Compared Jobs in the Same Field</h2>
        <p>After doing all this research I have come to several conclusions about software development as a career. Software development is a job that is easier to acquire than software engineering. This is because software engineering may require further education based on your employer, and it also may require certification in some states.</p>
        <p>It is also a much more fulfilling job with better pay and future job security than that of Programing, with similar education requirements. Through my research I have confirmed that this job pays better than programing jobs and is less likely to be automated though AI.</p>
        <h2>Effective Resumes</h2>
        <p>I have also concluded that one of the necessary skills that is needed to achieve a job in software development is an effective resume. This skill can increase your odds of getting to the interview stage. As you craft this, it helps you reflect on your own skill set which can help you be more prepared for the interview.</p>
        <h2>Salary</h2>
        <p>The primary reason people get a career is so that they can make money. Software development is a career that has a large enough salary, around $127,260 a year, to allow you to live comfortably. This is important in our current economy where the avg yearly US salary is only around $46,000. Software developers get paid on avg 2.5 times that amount with the upper range being about 4 times that, a value of $198,100.</p>
        <h2>Job Security</h2>
        <p>It is important when choosing a career to look at the future longevity of that career. Through my research, I have determined that the future is bright for software developers, as the number of jobs in the field is projected to increase by 26% over 10 years. Because there will be more availability for this job in the future your chances of getting a job in this field at a company you want to work for will keep increasing as the years go on.</p>
