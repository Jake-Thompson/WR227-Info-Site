            Recommendations (5+ paragraphs/1000+ words)<br>
            Advocates one or more possible courses of action in lieu of conclusions.<br>
            This is most important part of the website. Your recommendations page must show the reader what they can do
            to solve their problem. Guides, instructions, process analyses, and walk-throughs are appropriate on this
            webpage.<br>
            (Advising against taking action is a realistic recommendation, in certain cases.)

        <h1>Recommendations</h1>
        <p>The first recommendation I can give based on my research is, understand what the job entails and what it focuses on. Make sure you understand the differences between programming, software development and software engineering and do research on the differences so you can make an informed decision on which one is the best fit for your skill set.</p>
        <p>It is important that you understand the difference in focus. I did not understand the difference in focus between software development and software engineering before doing the research. Due to this, I actually changed my mind to instead pursue software engineering.</p>
        <p>I can recommend this job in general as the number of jobs over the next 10 years is set to increase, so you can rest assured that completing the education requirements is worth it.</p>
        <p>My final recommendation is that you learn how to write an effective resume. I have Included instructions for this <a href="recommendations/resume-instructions/">here</a> as well as two examples. The first example, <a href="recommendations/resume-instructions/example-1/">Example #1</a>, is for those that already have work experience in the field of software development. The second example, <a href="recommendations/resume-instructions/example-1/">Example #2</a>, is for those that are new to this career.</p>
